Many people

Bridge The Gap is dedicated to families and individuals in Arizona who are seeking resources that hundreds of non-profit organizations are providing.




## Why Make It?
We made Bridge the Gap to assist people in need during this difficult time. We reviewed other non-profit sites. Create a one stop shop for information providing user convenience. There is one that gives reviews on the different organizations. Ours has more information i.e. days and services without having going directly to  their site.



## What it Does

Provides a place for people looking for assistance in the areas of Food, Shelter, Daycare and Mental Health. It directs them to resources of non-profit organizations.
